# Simple-File-Transfer-Protocol
The project is a simple network protocol that can be used to download files from a remote site and to upload files to a remote site, and a client and a server programs that communicate using that protocol. The project requires three pieces of work: a network protocol specification, a client program that implements the client side of the protocol, and a server program that implements the server side of the protocol.
